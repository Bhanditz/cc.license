# An amalgamation of random TODO comments littered throughout cc.license

* replace "superseded" with "replacedBy" for RDF<->Python consistency

* Expose 'image uri' attribute from a License
** Make formatters use the exposed 'image uri' attribute

* Get to the bottom of finland license weirdness (see selectors/classes.py)

* Associate short codes with Licenses in the RDF

* Associate LicenseSelectors with Licenses in the RDF

(probably as a consequence of implementing the above)
* Add functionality to generate a license from a short code
  without having to first create a LicenseSelector

* Get image uri information for Licenses in the RDF

* Integrate questions.xml into RDF
** Map answers to licenses, somehow

* Implement LicenseSelector.jurisdictions and LicenseSelector.versions
  (This almost certainly relies upon the RDF updates described above)

* (possibly) Use distutils.version.StrictVersion for versioning (in License)

* Figure out what License.libre should return

* Cache all RDF models and use the same reference each time
