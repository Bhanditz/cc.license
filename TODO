== Critical ==
* Get License image uri in the RDF
** Expose 'image uri' attribute from a License
** Make formatters use the exposed 'image uri' attribute


== Important ==
* Handle 1.0 license weirdness, out-of-order license code (selectors/classes.py)

* Add functionality to generate a license from a short code
  without having to first create a LicenseSelector

* Clean up the answers-to-license-code hack

* Internationalizing HTML+RDFa formatter (license text)


== Minor ==
* replace "superseded" with "replacedBy" for RDF<->Python consistency
** Which should it be, and what needs to be replaced where?

* (possibly) Use distutils.version.StrictVersion for versioning (in License)

* Cache all RDF models and use the same reference each time
